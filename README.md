# Dice Game
## Description
This project simulates a dice game wherein players can choose to roll either three 6-sided or 8-sided dice. The outcomes of such rolls determine whether credits are added, removed, or unchanged (see gameplay section below for more information). The user begins with 10 credits and may continue to play until they run out of credits or issue a quit command.

## Gameplay
The player starts the game with 10 credits, and after each roll, one credit is removed from their credit balance.
However, if the user rolls a triple, double, or if the sum of all three dice is greater than 10, a credit is added.
The user plays until they do not have enough credits left, or if they enter 'stop'. 

## Purpose and Credits
This game was created primarily to practice classes and inheritance.
The files MyDie.java, SixDie.java, and the JUnit test were given by the instructors at GRCC for Computer Science II.
