# Dice-Game
This dice game is a simple game where players choose to roll either three 6-sided or 8-sided dice.
The player starts the game with 10 credits, and after each roll, one credit is removed from their credit balance.
However, if the user rolls a triple, double, or if the sum of all three dice is greater than 10, a credit is added.
The user plays until they do not have enough credits left, or if they enter 'stop'. 

This game was created primarily to practice classes and inheritance.
The files MyDie.java, SixDie.java, and the JUnit test were given by the instructors at GRCC for Computer Science II.
